									I recently had the most amazing vacation, and it was all made possible by Traveligo. I’d been wanting to visit a peaceful coastal town for ages, but I wasn’t sure where to go or how to plan it. That’s when I discovered Traveligo. The website made it so easy to explore different destinations, and I quickly found the perfect seaside town that offered both relaxation and adventure.

Booking my hotel was a breeze. Traveligo's search filters helped me find a cozy beachfront spot that fit my budget and had all the amenities I was looking for. The detailed descriptions and photos gave me confidence in my choice, and the real user reviews were incredibly helpful. Within minutes, I had my accommodation sorted and felt great about it.

Food is a big part of my travel experience, and Traveligo didn’t disappoint. I used the site to explore local dining options and found a range of amazing restaurants, from gourmet seafood places to charming little cafes. The menus, photos, and even the ability to make reservations directly through the site made my dining experiences effortless and memorable.

Planning my activities was also a highlight. Traveligo’s "Things to Do" section introduced me to so many fun options, including guided tours, water sports, and even a local festival that happened to be going on during my visit. I was able to create a personalized itinerary right on the site, which made my trip organized and stress-free.

One thing I really appreciated was the information on nearby medical centers. Although I didn’t end up needing them, knowing where to go in case of an emergency gave me peace of mind throughout my trip. It’s these thoughtful details that make Traveligo stand out.

My vacation turned out to be everything I hoped for and more. The hotel was exactly as described, the restaurants were fantastic, and the activities filled my days with unforgettable memories. Traveligo kept me updated with reminders and tips through their app, which was a nice touch. I came back home feeling refreshed and excited to plan my next adventure.

Traveligo made the whole process so easy and enjoyable that I’m already thinking about my next trip. I’ve shared my experiences with friends and can’t recommend Traveligo enough. If you’re looking to plan a trip, this is definitely the way to go!

										My recent trip to Goa was nothing short of magical, and I owe it all to Traveligo. I’d always dreamed of visiting Goa, but planning the perfect trip seemed overwhelming—until I found Traveligo. The site made everything so simple, from choosing the best spots to stay to finding hidden gems I wouldn’t have discovered on my own.

The first thing I did was search for a place to stay. Traveligo's filters helped me narrow down my choices to a beautiful beachside resort that fit both my budget and my desire for a luxurious experience. The photos and detailed descriptions made it easy to imagine myself there, and the positive reviews from other travelers sealed the deal. Booking was quick and hassle-free, and I was immediately excited for what was to come.

Goa is known for its vibrant food scene, and thanks to Traveligo, I was able to explore it to the fullest. I found an amazing variety of restaurants, from beachfront shacks serving fresh seafood to upscale dining spots offering fusion cuisine. Traveligo provided all the information I needed—menus, photos, and even the option to book a table directly through the site. Each meal turned out to be a highlight of my trip, filled with flavors I’ll never forget.

When it came to activities, Traveligo was my go-to guide. The "Things to Do" section offered everything from water sports and yoga retreats to exploring the local markets and historical sites. I ended up booking a guided tour of Old Goa, which was both informative and fun, and spent my afternoons lounging on the beach or shopping for souvenirs at the flea markets. Traveligo made it easy to plan each day so I could get the most out of my trip without feeling rushed.

One of the best parts of my Traveligo experience was the sense of security it provided. The site gave me information about nearby medical centers, which, thankfully, I didn’t need—but it was comforting to know that help was just a click away if I did.

My week in Goa flew by, but it was packed with incredible experiences that I’ll cherish forever. The resort was just as beautiful as described, the food was delicious, and every activity added a special touch to my vacation. Traveligo even kept me on track with reminders and tips through their app, which made the whole trip smooth and enjoyable.

Now that I’m back home, I can’t stop talking about my Goa adventure and how easy Traveligo made everything. I’ve already started planning my next trip using their platform because if there’s one thing I know for sure, it’s that Traveligo is the best way to travel. Highly recommend!

									I’ve gone with the word awesome (one of my favourites) to describe Agra but it’s more my description of the Taj Mahal, than the town itself. The Taj did not disappoint. It is truly awe inspiring. It’s gorgeous from a distance and also up close. But first to our journey…….

On the way from Jaipur to Agra we visited yet another fort called Fatehpur Sikri, but much like all the others it was impressive. It was built by a chap called Akbar and he had separate quarters for his three wives. For his Muslim wife he built a small room, for his Christian wife he built a wing of the palace, but for his Hindu wife who gave him an heir he built a whole entire palace!

Onwards to Agra where we were greeted by a cross between Las Vegas and India. Agra is a tourist town and I suspect 99% of visitors come to see the Taj Mahal and then move one. The main ‘tourist’ avenue is brightly lit with lots of neon lights and shops like Nike and KFC! Our hotel was full of fellow tourists from countries Iike Denmark, Japan and Ireland, which was a change from sharing with domestic tourists and the odd foreigner.

The other star attraction for our visit to Agra was the Holi festival, an annual Hindu festival that celebrates the Spring season.

Our Holi celebrations included a visit to a local bonfire ceremony called the Holika Dahan and the following day dressing in white pajamas and throwing colours (powders and sprays) at each other. It was kind of fun, but also a bit overrated. I enjoyed the local bonfire so much more.

Our guide Kamal is an Agra local and he graciously invited us all to observe the bonfire ceremony in his neighbourhood. In short, there is a large bonfire lit and people (I think it’s a man’s job) go to bonfire and Iight a dried cowpat (looks and smells better than it sounds) that’s attached to the end of a stick. They then take the ‘fire’ and light their own fire at home. The best part for us was the whole village of people singing and chanting and inviting us to join in. It was an honour to be part of it.

Conversely our ‘colour’ throwing felt more Iike a tourist activity. It also involved loads of preparation with special oil in my hair, coconut oil for my skin (throwback to my teenage years) and nail polish. This was all in an effort to avoid staining my hair, skin and nails with the bright colours which for the most part worked. It was kind of fun but I’m not sure the preparation and the scrubbing after was justified by the work.

My first glimpse of the beautiful Taj was an early morning yoga class led by an enthusiastic Indian man in a tracksuit. Not quite the yogic experience I was expecting, but fun nonetheless. And who could fault the view!

Our first proper look at the magnificent structure we had all come to see was from across the river from a beautiful park in the late afternoon. Wow Wow Wow.

This was followed by an early morning visit the next day to view it up close which was amazing! Although it was crawling with tourists even at 6.30 am, it was still awesome.

After the Taj we detoured to the Agra Fort which, while impressive was nothing on the Taj! I also suspect I’m a bit fatigued.

									<p>
										Himachal Pradesh, known for its breathtaking landscapes and rich cultural heritage, is set to host a mega festival named 'Dehra Utsav' by the end of 2024. This announcement was made by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu during his visit to the Dehra Assembly Constituency recently.
										The 'Dehra Utsav' is expected to be a grand celebration, highlighting the traditional art, music, dance, and crafts that define Himachal Pradesh’s cultural identity. The event will provide a platform for local artisans and performers to display their talents, fostering a deeper appreciation of the state’s cultural diversity. By bringing these traditions to the forefront, the festival is anticipated to attract both domestic and international tourists, contributing to the region’s economic growth.

									<h2 ><a href="#">India Introduces Visa-on-Arrival for Japanese, South Korean, and UAE Citizens</a></h2>
									<p>
										In a significant move to attract more international tourists, India has launched a visa-on-arrival facility for citizens of Japan, South Korea, and the UAE starting August 2024. This facility allows travelers from these countries to obtain a 60-day visa upon arrival at major Indian airports, streamlining the process for business, tourism, medical, and conference visits. This initiative is part of India's broader efforts to simplify travel procedures and boost its appeal as a global tourist destination.
										India is making strides to boost tourism by simplifying the visa process for citizens of Japan, South Korea and the UAE. Effective in August 2024, travellers from these nations will be able to obtain a visa-on-arrival when visiting India for tourism, business, medical purposes or even official conferences. This new facility will grant a 60-day visa upon arrival at six major Indian airports: Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai. The visa-on-arrival will come with a fee of `2,000.

Eligible travellers will need to download, fill out and submit an application form to the Visa Officer at the visa-on-arrival counters. The form will be available at the counters, on incoming aircraft and can also be filled out upon arrival. In addition, a duly completed disembarkation card will need to be submitted. A double-entry facility may be granted at the discretion of the Immigration Office. However, certain conditions and restrictions will apply to ensure the smooth functioning of the new visa-on-arrival system.

Currently, India also offers an e-visa facility with Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) to nationals of 167 countries, allowing entry through 30 designated international airports and six major seaports across the country. The Ministry of Home Affairs has recently approved an Integrated Check Post (ICP) for foreign nationals holding e-visas, which is set to significantly impact the tourism landscape.

The introduction of e-visas is expected to be a game-changer, particularly for regions like the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Previously, yachts and cruise ships could only pass by the islands; now, they can dock, bringing both direct and indirect revenue. This new policy will extend beyond Port Blair to include five other major seaports: Mumbai, New Mangalore, Cochin, Mormugao and Chennai. This interconnected network aims to streamline entry for e-visa holders, making the Andaman and Nicobar Islands more accessible than ever before.

Authorities have meticulously planned this development to ensure a seamless experience for international guests, aligning with their vision of positioning the islands as a premier destination for global tourists. This initiative is expected to significantly boost yacht tourism in the region and elevate the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on the global tourism map. Local tour operators have welcomed the move, noting that the e-visa system will attract not only foreign travellers but also Indian yacht enthusiasts, thereby promoting domestic tourism as well.

									<p>
										The UNWTO cited that Kerala Tourism has succeeded in upholding the world body’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while promoting travel industry in the State, said a release here on Tuesday. Kerala has been cited for employing local resources and products while boosting RT destinations, thus finding resources to achieve its objectives towards realising the SDGs. The dashboard displays Kerala Tourism’s website link for details about the State’s activities.

Congratulating the State RT Mission on the accomplishment, Tourism Minister P.A. Mohamed Riyas said Kerala’s initiative in promoting sustainable and inclusive tourism had been earning international acclaims for a while now. “Tourists across the globe are watching our activities with great interest,” he noted. “The UNWTO’s recognition will further inspire us to promote eco-friendly tourism.”

Kerala’s RT Mission earned a place among seven G20 countries with Maharashtra being the only other Indian State to figure on the list which cites its Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve project. Kerala RT’s selection to the Special Dashboard has been based on the State’s tourism promotion initiatives in adherence with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Significantly, the UNWTO citation comes close on the heels of the Kerala RT Mission getting the prestigious Global Award, acknowledging the sustainable and women-inclusive initiatives successfully promoted in the State. The award, instituted by the Responsible Tourism Partnership and International Centre for Responsible Tourism (ICRT), is in the ‘Best for Local Sourcing – Craft and Food’ category.

									<h2 ><a href="#">Tourism sector could resolve 50% of India's employment challenges</a></h2>
									<p>
										The tourism sector has the potential to resolve 50 per cent of the country's employment challenges with the right government support, Lemon Tree Hotels Chairman and Managing Director Patanjali Govind Keswani said on Saturday. Delivering his address at the first National Conclave on India 2047, organised by IIM Calcutta, he said India's tourism sector is on the verge of hitting the inflexion point.
										
"If the government can leverage this opportunity effectively, it could address up to 50 per cent of our employment challenges," he said.

Discussing India's current economic landscape, Keswani remarked that the country is at a critical juncture, similar to where China was during its rapid growth phase.As tourism rebounds to near pre-pandemic levels in 2024, the industry faces a host of sustainability challenges that require urgent attention. The rapid return of international travel, particularly by air, has reignited concerns about the environmental impacts of tourism. Carbon emissions from air travel, which had dipped during the pandemic, are now surging back, raising the specter of returning to, or even surpassing, pre-pandemic levels of environmental damage. Popular destinations are also grappling with the effects of over-tourism, where excessive visitor numbers lead to pollution, habitat destruction, and unsustainable strain on local resources.

Over-tourism not only harms the environment but also has significant social consequences. In cities like Venice and Barcelona, the influx of tourists has led to overcrowding, driving up the cost of living and reducing the quality of life for residents. These issues have sparked local protests and prompted authorities to implement measures aimed at reducing tourist numbers, such as limiting access to certain areas and promoting off-season travel. Despite these efforts, achieving a balance between sustaining tourism revenue and preserving local communities remains a complex challenge.
